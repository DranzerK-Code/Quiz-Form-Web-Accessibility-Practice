# Quiz-Form-Web-Accessibility-Practice
A responsive and accessible quiz form built to practice semantic HTML and inclusive design principles.

# Quiz Form – Web Accessibility Practice

This is a simple quiz form I built while learning HTML and CSS through [freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).  
The goal was to practice writing accessible HTML, using labels, proper form structure, and some basic CSS to style things up.

## 📝 About the Project

The form includes:
- Sections for user info and multiple-choice questions
- Questions about HTML and CSS basics
- ARIA roles and semantic HTML elements for better accessibility
- A clean layout with a rounded container and subtle background image

I also added a soft, blurred background to make the design look more polished without being distracting.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to create accessible forms using proper label/input relationships
- The role of ARIA attributes and headings for screen reader support
- Using CSS `::before` pseudo-elements to add a styled background layer
- Responsive styling and layout tricks (like `max()` and `min()`)
